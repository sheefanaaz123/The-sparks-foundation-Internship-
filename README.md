# The Sparks Foundation Internship

This repository contains the tasks of Data Science and Business Analytics intern
at The Sparks Foundation.

## TASK 1

In this project we have to predict the marks of the student based on the number of study hours. I have used Linear Regression algorithm here. I chosen mean square error for evaluation. Here we have a model with  
*Mean Absolute Error*: 4.183859899002982
## TASK 2

In this task we have to predict the optimum number of clusters in the 'Iris Dataset'. I have used K-Means Classifier here.
## TASK 3
 
In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on The superstore dataset. I found the weak areas where we have to put more effort.
